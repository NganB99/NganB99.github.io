      <p class="MyIntroduction">
        I'm a sophomore at Millersville University with a major in graphic
        design. My passion for graphic design is deeply rooted in the vibrant
        and dynamic world of game design. From a young age, I was captivated by
        video games' immersive visuals and artistic storytelling. This
        fascination blossomed into a career path when I realized the powerful
        impact of graphic design in crafting these interactive experiences. I am
        particularly drawn to the challenge of blending artistic elements with
        user experience, striving to create visually appealing, emotionally
        engaging, and intuitive game environments. My journey in graphic design
        is fueled by a desire to contribute to the gaming world, where every
        texture, character, and interface plays a crucial role in bringing
        imaginative universes to life. It's more than creating art; it's about
        building experiences that resonate with players and leave a lasting
        impression.

      <p class="ThirdTagText">
        My design aesthetic is heavily influenced by the anime art style,
        characterized by its vibrant visuals and emphasis on cuteness. A deep
        appreciation for animated films and video games inspires this unique
        approach.
